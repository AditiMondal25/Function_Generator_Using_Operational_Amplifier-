# Function_Generator_Using_Operational_Amplifier-
This project designs a Function Generator using the UA741CP operational amplifier to produce square, triangle, and sine waves at adjustable frequencies. It demonstrates waveform generation, frequency control, and the use of op-amps in electronics. Ideal for testing, calibration, and educational purposes.
