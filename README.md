# Function Generator Using Operational Amplifier
## Overview
This repository contains the design, implementation, and evaluation of a function generator built using operational amplifiers (op-amps). Function generators are essential instruments in electronics laboratories that generate a variety of electrical waveforms used for testing, calibration, and experimentation. In this project, we develop a simple yet efficient function generator circuit and explore the different waveform generation techniques using op-amps.

This project focuses on the theoretical concepts behind function generators, including signal conditioning, waveform synthesis, and frequency modulation. Through a combination of circuit analysis, schematic design, simulation, and real-world prototyping, this project demonstrates how op-amps can be leveraged to build a reliable and versatile function generator.
